 * Context providing methods for the parallel execution of computationally expensive tasks. Tasks

 * <p>
 * You should always use the {@code ConcurrencyContext} provided by the current execution
 * environment (e.g., via injection). More specifically, as user of the RapidMiner API, you should
 * never implement this interface on your own.
 * <p>
 * Despite managing multithreaded computations, {@code ConcurrencyContext} implementations
 * themselves need <strong>not</strong> be <strong>thread-safe</strong>. As a consequence, you
 * should never invoke a context's methods recursively, e.g., from within a submitted task. Consider
 * submitting an appropriate {@link ForkJoinTask} instead.
